Things for 2.5:
[09:27] <hyc> we also need to audit all of these schema defs
[09:27] <hyc> we're supposed to have official, non-experimental OIDs for released schema
[09:28] <hyc> accesslog is still using 666, experimental arc
[09:29] <hyc> I think this means we should polish up the logschema draft, Informational status, and publish it again as final

Add support to cn=config for global overlays so they are usable
